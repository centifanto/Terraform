# Terraform

This is my base plan/template that I have written/assembled for launching three separate portions of an AWS environment all from your local computer. Obviously, one can change the location of the files to the cloud if desired. There is the VPC portion, the logging portion, and finally launching the EC2 instances. You can run only one or all of them depending on your needs. I have thoroughly commented everything so it should be readily understandable.

Very soon I will be writing and linking here a blog post on how to use everything here, and unique functions of the code that I am very happy with the end result.
