# Terraform
This is my Terraform playbook that I have written/assembled for launching three separate portions of an AWS environment all from your local computer. There is the VPC portion, the logging portion, and finally launching the EC2 instances. You can run only one or all of them depending on your needs.

Here is my blog post where I reference how to use the playbook --> https://blog.centifanto.net/2021/02/aws-terraform-automation-round-2.html
